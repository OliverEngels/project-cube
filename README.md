# Project Cube
The Cube Project was inspired by a beloved puzzle game from the 1970s. This project serves as a playground for delving into Three.js and for me to explore the possibilities of creating interactive 3D web experiences.

## Tech Stack
- [**Three.js**](https://threejs.org/) *(WebGL)*: Library for 3D graphics in the web.
- [**Typescript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): JavaScript with static type checking
- [**React**](https://react.dev/): JavaScript Library

## Project Status
Currently, the Cube Project is in a functional state, I accomplished my learning objectives. While the code might not follow the best practices to the letter, it serves its purpose effectively. I may in the future refactor some of the code or exploring additional features.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install any necessary dependencies.
```
[yarn / npm] install
```
3. Run the project locally to explore the 3D interactions.
```
[yarn / npm] start
```
